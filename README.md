SongShift is an Android app that makes it easy to share and discover music. It converts Spotify track or album URLs into links for Deezer, YouTube Music, and YouTube.

## Features

- **URL Conversion**: Enter a Spotify track or album URL and get Deezer, YouTube Music, and YouTube links for the same content.
- **Smart Link Detection**: Handles shared Spotify links directly from other apps.
- **Clipboard Integration**: You can copy Deezer and YouTube links with a single tap.
- **Easy to set up**: The app helps you set it up so that Spotify URLs go to this app by default.

## How It Works

1. **Paste or share a Spotify URL**.
2. The app fetches track details using Spotify's API and searches for matching tracks or albums on Deezer.
3. **Output**: Provides clickable links and options to copy them to your clipboard for Deezer, YouTube and YouTube Music.
